## QuickCal
A quick, clean calendar written in Vue.js

# About
QuickCal provides a lightweight alternative to bulky calendar suites, ideal for quick to-dos or notes for a particular day.

# Technologies
QuickCal was written written with Vue.js and relies extensively on Moment.js to build the calendar's core functionality. It uses the Vuex library/pattern for state management across components, and a Mongo database for data persistence.
